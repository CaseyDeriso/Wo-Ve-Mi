## Milestones:

### Casey:

## I struggled through learning a new CSS framework, but it was worth it.

## After learning the framework, I had fun manipulating elements to stack neatly on different screen sizes.

### Garrett:

## Dealing with multiple fetch requests and accounting for the time it takes them to complete was a challenge.

## I learned about the strange things that can happen when you mix asynchronous and synchronous functions and how to work around them.
